  ## Project Description
  With this app using express, allows the user to take and save notes with a local Api. It has full functionality, so one can write notes, save them to a list on the side, and delete the ones they don't need anymore

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo from Github, download the packages, and run the server on your local pc!

  ## Usage
  Take notes! The world is your oyster

  ## How to Contribute
  Any contributions with cleaning up the code, or making it more readable would be appricated!

  ## Testing
  It shouldn't need more testing, it is quite basic in design. But once could write an extremely long title for a note and see what that does to the saved notes list
